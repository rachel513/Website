      <h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Rachel Dean and I'm currently a junior at the University of Texas at Austin. I was born in Orange County, CA and moved to Austin, TX when I was really young. I have a brother, Joseph, who also goes to UT Austin. He followed in our father's footsteps and is an Electrical Engineering (EE) major and plans to get his Ph.D in the topic. My family's from Taiwan and a couple of summers ago, after a mountain of paperwok, I became a dual citizen of USA and Taiwan. I have a dog named Molly - she's a Maltese and I've had her since 1st grade.</p>
<p>Sophomore year of high school, I got the opportunity to attend Texas Academy of Mathematicsa and Science (TAMS), which gave me the opportunity to attend real college courses taught by college professors at UNT. At UT Austin, I'm a Biology BSA major, pre-med, with a Business minor. I'm planning on applying to medical schools the summer of 2020.</p>
<h2 id="education">EDUCATION</h2>
<p>High School:</p>
<p>Vandergrift High School (9 - 10th)</p>
<p>Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science (11 - 12th)</p>
<p>College:</p>
<p>University of Texas at Austin (Fall 2017 - Present)</p>
<h2 id="interests">INTERESTS</h2>
<p>I love trying new things - skydiving, actual diving, ATVing, etc. I also love food and continually having new culinary experiences - I like to say that it's because my parents are also foodies and have been taking me to a lot of different restaurants since I was a kid. As a happy consequence of my love for food, I also love cooking and baking.</p>
<p>As for my academic interests, I have a profound love for biology. Because I completely all of my introductory courses while at TAMS, at UNT (University of North Texas), I was able to take upper divisision courses as a freshmen and thus got a head start. As a result, I learned early on that Genetics was the subcategory of Biology that I loved the most and excelled at. This semester, I had the distinct privilege of enrolling in a Graduate-Level course, BIO 395J Genes/Gene Expression/Genomics (first undergraduate to do so). This course really opened my eyes in how much we as scientists still don't know and how the field is constantly changing.</p>
<h2 id="work-experience">WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>I currently work as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UGTA) with Dr. Ann Thijs for Introductory to Biology I and II. As a UGTA, I lead my own discussion sections, proctor and grade exams, hold office hours, and help with lecture activities. Ultimately, I help Dr. Thijs run the course and serve as a mentor to hundreds of students.</p>
<p>I also work as a Tutor at the Sanger Learning Center on campus (3rd floor in Jester). I tutor Intro Biology I &amp; II, Intro Chemistry I &amp; II, Genetics, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry, Human Systems Physiology, Anatomy, and Accounting.</p>
<h2 id="volunteering">VOLUNTEERING</h2>
<p>I currently volunteer at multiple locations. I volunteer at Home Cook Fridays, a soup kitchen that has a new approach on feeding the homeless and hungry that helps them regain their dignity and self-respect. I've been volunteering there every Friday since Fall semester of my freshmen year. Additionally, I volunteer at Dell Children's Medical Center in the Wayfinding Department and the Emergency Department. By volunteering at DCMC, I've gained valuable insight into how the hospital adminstration works and how to interact and patients and their families.</p>
<h2 id="skills">SKILLS</h2>
<ul>
<li>fluent in Mandarin</li>
<li>benchwork/wet lab techniques (Biology research)</li>
<li>proficient in piano and flute</li>
<li>multitasking</li>
<li>basic coding in RStudio and python</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contact">CONTACT</h2>
<p>I can be contacted via email at <a href="mailto:rachel_dean@utexas.edu">rachel_dean@utexas.edu</a></p>
