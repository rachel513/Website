      <description>In the month that we as a class were working on Python, I found that the topic that I enjoyed the most is isolating specific phrases using regex (regular expression). Figuring it out how to isolate certain sections is like a puzzle, which is what I like most about Genetics and Genomics work (my focus in academics). It’s kind of like figuring out a pedigree - what’s an individual’s likely genotype given their phenotype and their relatives’ phenotypes, what’s the mode of inheritance, etc.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe first dataset I chose was from by SDS 328M project. At the time, I was really into global inequality after taking a government course, Politics of Poverty. In the dataset, I randomly chose 64 countries and from the CIA World FactBook (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/profileguide.html) and looked up their GINI coefficient (which measures the amount of inequality), infant mortality, and GDP per capital (in US dollars). The second dataset from data.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION Hi! My name is Rachel Dean and I&#39;m currently a junior at the University of Texas at Austin. I was born in Orange County, CA and moved to Austin, TX when I was really young. I have a brother, Joseph, who also goes to UT Austin. He followed in our father&#39;s footsteps and is an Electrical Engineering (EE) major and plans to get his Ph.D in the topic. My family&#39;s from Taiwan and a couple of summers ago, after a mountain of paperwok, I became a dual citizen of USA and Taiwan.</description>
