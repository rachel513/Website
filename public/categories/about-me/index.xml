      <description>INTRODUCTION Hi! My name is Rachel Dean and I&#39;m currently a junior at the University of Texas at Austin. I was born in Orange County, CA and moved to Austin, TX when I was really young. I have a brother, Joseph, who also goes to UT Austin. He followed in our father&#39;s footsteps and is an Electrical Engineering (EE) major and plans to get his Ph.D in the topic. My family&#39;s from Taiwan and a couple of summers ago, after a mountain of paperwok, I became a dual citizen of USA and Taiwan.</description>
