<p>In the month that we as a class were working on Python, I found that the topic that I enjoyed the most is isolating specific phrases using regex (regular expression). Figuring it out how to isolate certain sections is like a puzzle, which is what I like most about Genetics and Genomics work (my focus in academics). It’s kind of like figuring out a pedigree - what’s an individual’s likely genotype given their phenotype and their relatives’ phenotypes, what’s the mode of inheritance, etc.</p>

<p>In this example, we are separating out all the numbers. From looking at this string, we can see that there are a variety of characters that separate the numbers - there’s commas, spaces, dollar signs, backwards spaces. So, we can’t isolate the numbers by stopping before one specific character. Instead, we can use an exclusion tactic - only include numbers and nothing else. So, a backslash followed by “d” will give you only digits and by adding the “+” at the end, that means that it will give you back all the digits of the number, as long as they are consecutive and uninterrupted.</p>

<p>For this string, in order to separate out and return all the MAC addresses, we have to target alphanumericals because the characters that fell in between the the colons are both digits and letters. On top of that, there’s no specific pattern as to which positions are digits and which are letters, so we have to use an inclusive capturing method. A backslash followed by a “w” represents alphanumerics, the “{2}” means that we are looking for 2 consecutive alphnumerics, and backslash followed by a “:” means that we are separating the 6 sets of 2 consecutive alphanumerics with colons.</p>

string3 = r&quot;We try to quantitatively capture these characteristics by defining a set of indexes,\ which can be computed using the mosaic image and the corresponding ground trut h: \ \begin{itemize} \   \item $\mu_{A_T}$ and $\sigma_{A_T}$, the mean and standard deviation of t he tiles area $A_T$, respectively; \   \item $\rho_\text{filler}$, the ratio between the filler area and the over all mosaic are, computed as \ $\rho_\text{filler}=\frac{\sum_{T \in \mathcal{T} A_T}}{A}$, being $A$ the are a of the mosaic; \   \item \todo{does it worth?}; \   \item \todo{does it worth?}; \   \item $\mu_{C_T}$, the mean of the tiles \emph{color dispersion} $C_T$, \ being $C_T = \sigma_R+\sigma_G+\sigma_B$, where $\sigma_R$, $\sigma_G$ and $\s igma_B$ are the \ standard deviation of the red, green and blue channel values of the pixels wit hin the tile $T$.\ After applying a method to an image, we compare the segmented image (i.e., the result) \ against the ground truth and assess the performance according to the following three metrics: \ \begin{itemize} \   \item average tile precision $P$ \   \item average tile recall $R$ \   \item tile count error $C$&quot;

<p>In this example, we are isolating consecutive $s and everything in between those $s. This one was more difficult for me. When I was first coding this, I was stuck on a code that kept on returning strings of characters bordered by $s, but I would include several $s in between the starting and ending $s. However, by adding a ? after the *, I was able to isolate each instance of characters separated by $ without including $s in between.</p>
